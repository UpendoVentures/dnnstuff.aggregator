# Aggregator Nesting Tabs 



Nesting tabs is actually quite easy. Just add two Aggregators to your
page and to each one, add the tabs you'd like. Then in the Aggregator
that you want as the parent Aggregator, go into it and add the other
Aggregator into one of the tabs by using the Add Existing module feature
just like you'd add any other module to a tab.
