Sample1 - Basic
- shows a basic top tab setup - nothing fancy here
- active tab shown in blue (#7799ee)
- inactive tabs shown in white (#fff)

Sample2 - Add Tab Numbers to Tab Captions
- adds the tab number to the tab template (tab.html), code added is [TABNUMBER].&nbsp;
- you could also add that code to the tab caption within the tab setup, but adding it here is a one shot deal and will
  work with all of the tabs that use the template

Sample3 - Change some colors
- changed tabpage background color to white (#fff) (see .Sample_Sample3_TabPage)
- changed unselected tab top, right. left border to blue (#7799ee) (see .Sample_Sample3_TabStrip .Sample_Sample3_TabUnselected)

Sample4 - Add nicer pagination
- you'll need the Show Prev Next setting turned on to see this one
- changed Paging.html to include images - images are from the free Silk Icon set from famfamfam (http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/)
- changed styles.css to give the Paging class a nicer look; borders, font smaller

Sample5 - Move pagination to tab page
- paging.html changed to show only the next page link along with the caption and tabnumber of the next page
- tabpage.html changed to show the [PAGING] link inside the tab page
- styles.css changed slightly to position to the right side of the page
